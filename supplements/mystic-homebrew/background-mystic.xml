			<p>By magic, psionics, communing with spirits or otherwise, there are special people who have a sixth sense. These people sense things invisible to most others. As a mystic do you see your power as a curse rather than a gift? Are you able to control your power or does it happen randomly? Is it given to you by a greater power or did these powers develop over time?</p>

			<p>With your mystical powers you have witnessed an impactful event. The nature of how you experienced this depends on your specialization. The event might be a person battling against another person, the destruction of an important artifact, a god bringing a plague or perhaps a meteorite crashing onto a city. You can describe this situation in visual/emotional detail but can't name an exact time or place. This information might clash with the current beliefs, norms or values of your setting. Causing conflict or shunned expressions from others when mentioned. Work with your DM about the details and the importance of this event and what impact it might have on the campaign.</p>
